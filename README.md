# ACC-Toolkit
This is a simple app I decided to make for a few reasons:

1. As of right now (9/4/2025) I am four days into my new term which includes a course on mobile development, and I wanted to test the waters.
2. I'm about the submit an application to Walmart's internship and I wanted to have something relevant to show, as well as showing I'm already helping their employee(s) (at least me) be more productive.
3. There are a few minor issues at the ACC counter that could be rectified by using this app (I'll explain more below).

## Issues this app solves

So, there are a few minor issues I think could be alleviated by the features of this app.

### Road Hazard Calculator 

The first would be calculating the Road Hazard Warranty for our tires. Specifically, calculating how much the customer would pay towards a new replacement after determining it is non-repairable.

The ACC system does this automatically, IF the service writer and the technicians push the paperwork through correctly, which doesn't always happen. 
We could rewrite the paperwork and have it work out that way, but that takes more time than we're willing to give, so we usually override these issues at the register.

That should work fine, but more often than not, when I see some of my fellow associates looking at the calculation chart posted in our office, they end up getting confused and ask me to verify their calculations.
So, I figured I'd take the second guesses out of the process and just make a simple calculator to use.

### UPC Collection

The second issue is somewhat similar to the first, in that it stems from paperwork that wasn't correct.

We have scenarios where something pops up in the paperwork that the customer didn't ask for, for example, the customer wanted a one-time balance instead of a lifetime balance.

This should be simple, right? Just void the lifetime balance and add the one-time balance. It would be that simple, if we had the UPC or barcode to enter in.

We have some extra barcodes to scan for a few other services, but I've asked for the rest and was told there was no way to access them. 
This leads to some customers getting the lifetime balance for the one-time price, which erks me.

So I decided to make a collection/list of useful UPCs for the ACC, which can be rendered as a barcode for ease of use at the register.
